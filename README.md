# Project description, motivation
We created a flow of learning Quantum Computing. We believe enhancing the quantum community is crucial for the further development of quantum computing. For beginner, learning quantum computing is not an easy task. Yes, we know there are lot of resources online, but many of them are difficult to understand. That is why we came up with a learning flow in which people can learn quantum computing more efficiently.

Our learning flow starts from allotting players to each level. Beginner, intermediate, and pro. Due to the time limit of assignment, we only created the part for Beginner this time. 

After players are alloted in notebook file, they will explore the 3D game in which they learn concepts in a 3D world by interacting and watching explanation videos. 

After that, players come back to the original notebook file in which they will implement what they have learned in the 3D world. They will be assigned to solve some tasks related to what they have learned. 

From these steps, players not only learn concepts in 3D, but they also learn how to implement them for quantum computing using languages such as Qiskit. 

Moreover, players experience real-life application of quantum computing in "Quantum Random Number Generator Using Qiskit - WQ_07_IBM.ipynb" file.

For this project, we implemented random number generator with which players can play with Japanese Omikuji, fortune generating tradition in Japan.

First, open "main_notebook.ipynb" file. In that file, you will be navigated to quantum_game which you can download from "quantum_game" folder and play. Then, again in "main_notebook.ipynb" file, you will run several codes and solve some tasks. After you finished solving tasks, you proceed to "Quantum Random Number Generator Using Qiskit - WQ_07_IBM.ipynb" file and experience the real-life application of quantum computing.

# Instruction for how to proceed in the notebook file
"main_notebook.ipynb" is the notebook file which contains the guide for how to proceed and contains tasks to solve.

You will find the most of instruction here.

Download the file and open in IBM Lab or Jupyter. 

At the beginning, you will have to install some packages and import several libraries.

Then, you just need to follow the instruction in the notebook file. 

# Instruction for how to open the game
First, download the zipped file from this repository.

After downloaded, open the files in a text editor. 

Make sure you have installed Ursina and panda3d packages.

Navigate to the game folder on CLI app. 

Executing "python main.py" or "python3 main.py" will launch the game

## Instruction for how to play the game.
When you launched the game, you will see the instruction for how to play the game.

In the 3d world, you will explore Bloch Sphere. 

You can press the buttons that represent gates in quantum computing. The quantum state changes accordingly.

The look of Bloch Sphere and quantum gates is the follow.

# What to expect in "main_notebook.ipynb" file
In main_notebok.ipynb file, you will see a group of codes written in cells. 

Please read the instructions and comments as you proceed in the file.

You will expect to see some quantum circuits with several quantum gates. 

You not only run the given codes, but you also have to solve some tasks given in the file. 

# What to expect in "Quantum Random Number Generator Using Qiskit - WQ_07_IBM.ipyynb"

You will see how quantum computing is implemented in real-life. 

In our case, you will play a simple Omikuji, a traditional Japanese fortune generator.
