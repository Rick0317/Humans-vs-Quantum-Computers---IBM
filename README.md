# Project description, motivation
We created a flow of learning Quantum Computing. We believe enhancing the quantum community is crucial for the further development of quantum computing. For beginner, learning quantum computing is not an easy task. Yes, we know there are lot of resources online, but many of them are difficult to understand. That is why we came up with a learning flow in which people can learn quantum computing more efficiently.

Our learning flow starts from allotting players to each level. Beginner, intermediate, and pro. Due to the time limit of assignment, we only created the part for Beginner this time. 

After players are alloted in notebook file, they will explore the 3D game in which they learn concepts in a 3D world by interacting and watching explanation videos. 

After that, players come back to the original notebook file in which they will implement what they have learned in the 3D world. They will be assigned to solve some tasks related to what they have learned. 

From these steps, players not only learn concepts in 3D, but they also learn how to implement them for quantum computing using languages such as Qiskit. 

# Instruction for how to proceed in the notebook file
the notebook file is 


# Instruction for how to open the game
First, download the zipped file from this repository.

After downloaded, open the files in a text editor. 

Make sure you have installed Ursina and panda3d packages.

Navigate to the game folder on CLI app. 

Execute "python main.py" or "python3 main.py" will launch the game

## Instruction for how to play the game.
When you launched the game, you will see the instruction for how to play the game.

In the 3d world, you will explore Bloch Sphere. 

You can press the buttons that represent gates in quantum computing. The quantum state changes accordingly.

The look of Bloch Sphere and quantum gates is the follow.
